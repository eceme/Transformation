# Transformation
* It is a laboratory exercies within the scope of computer graphics.
* In this lab, it was requested to write a GUI application using AWT.
* We draw the line that divides the screen into four equal parts.
* Then we create a triangle with the dimensions given in x [] and y [] arrays and paint it in the color we want.
* There are six buttons on our menu panel.
* The buttons are used to shift the triangle to the right, left, up, down and reflect on the x, y axes.
* With the Set Default button, we set the triangle in its initial state.
